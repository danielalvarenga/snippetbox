	// Servemux supports two types of URL patterns:
	// * Subtree paths: it ends with trailing slash, like "/" or "/public/", and
	// catch any URl path starting with the pattern, like a wildcard ("/**" or "/public/**")
	// * Fixed paths: it doesn't end with trailing slash and is catched only when the
	// URL path is exactly the same
	//
	// Important:
	// * Servemux doesn't support RESTful functionalities like http methods, variables or
	// regexp in routes. Recommended to use third-party routers.
	// * Longer URL patterns takes precedence over shorter ones
	// * URL patterns are automatically sanitized and redirected (301 Permanent Redirect)
	// to the correspondent path. Ex: "/any/../foo//bar" to "/any/foo/bar"
	// * Request without trailing slash that matches with some subtree path is redirected
	// (301 Permanent Redirect) to subtree path. Ex: "/any" to "/any/"
	// * URL pattenrs accepts host names like "foo.any.com/create"
	// * Instead explicitly declare a servemux and use mux.HandleFunc(),
	// you can use http.HandleFunc() directly. It uses the global variable "DefaultServeMux"
	// implicitly created by "net/http" package, but it isn't safe because any package
	// can access global variables and handle this in your application.
	mux := http.NewServeMux()
	mux.HandleFunc("/", home)
	mux.HandleFunc("/snippet/view", snippetView)
	mux.HandleFunc("/snippet/create", snippetCreate)

	// The function http.ListenAndServe() should receive the TCP network
	// in the format "host:port" to specifics host and port number or
	// ":port" to any host and specific port number or
	// ":my-port-name" to use named port that Go will try to get the
	// correspondence from "/etc/services"
	log.Println("Starting server on :4000")
	err := http.ListenAndServe(":4000", mux)
	log.Fatal(err)
